# Operational-Research-Project
In this project, I used LINGO to build linear programming models to solve 11 problems for an auto assembly company.

The background of this company:

A large company manufacturing automobiles produces trucks, small cars, and midsized
luxury cars. One plant close to Detroit, MI, assembles two models of midsized luxury cars.
The first model, the Family Adventurer, is a four-door sedan with vinyl seats, plastic interior,
standard features, and excellent gas mileage. It is marketed as a smart buy for middle-class
families with tight budgets, and each Family Adventurer sold generates a modest profit of
$3,700 for the company. The second model, the Classic Transporter, is a two-door luxury
sedan with leather seats, wooden interior, custom features, and navigational capabilities.
It is marketed as a privilege of affluence for upper-middle-class families, and each Classic
Transporter sold generates a profit of $5, 300 for the company.

William Smith, the manager of the plant, is currently deciding the production schedule
for the next month. Specifically, he must decide how many Family Adventurers and how
many Classic Transporters to assemble in the plant to maximize the profit for the company.
He knows that the plant possesses a capacity of 48,500 labor-hours during the month. He also
knows that it takes 6 labor-hours to assemble one Family Adventurer and 10.5 labor-hours
to assemble one Classic Transporter. Because the plant is simply an assembly plant, the
parts required to assemble the two models are not produced at the plant. They are instead
shipped from other plants around the Michigan area to the assembly plant. For example,
tires, steering wheels, windows, seats and doors all arrive from various supplier plants. For
the next month, William knows that he will be able to obtain only 20,000 doors (10,000
left-hand doors and 10,000 right-hand doors) from the door supplier. A recent labor strike
forced the shutdown of that particular supplier plant for several days, and that plant will not
be able to meet its production schedule for the next month. Both the Family Adventurer
and the Classic Transporter use the same door part.

In addition, a recent company forecast of the monthly demands for different automobile
models suggests that the demand for the Classic Transporter is limited to 3,500 cars. There
is no limit on the demand for the Family Adventurer within the capacity limits of the assembly plant.

Questions:

Problem 1. Formulate a linear programming model for this problem to determine the
number of Family Adventurers and Classic Transporters that should be assembled. Explain
if a linear model is appropriate for this problem.

Problem 2. Solve the problem using Lingo or Excel and interpret the result. Determine if
this problem has a unique solution.

Problem 3. The marketing department knows that it can pursue a targeted $500,000 advertising campaign that will raise the demand for the Classic Transporter next month by 20
percent. Should the campaign be undertaken?

Problem 4. William knows that he can increase next monthâ€™s plant capacity by using
overtime labor. He can increase the plants labor-hour capacity by 25 percent. With the new
assembly plant capacity, how many Family Adventurers and how many Classic Transporters
should be assembled?

Problem 5. William knows that overtime labor does not come without an extra cost.
What is the maximum amount he should be willing to pay for all overtime labor beyond the
cost of this labor at regular time rates?

Problem 6. William explores the option of using both the targeted advertising campaign
and the overtime labor-hours. The advertising campaign raises the demand for the Classic
Transporter by 20 percent, and the overtime labor increases the plants labor-hour capacity
by 25 percent. How many Family Adventurers and how many Classic Transporters should
be assembled using the advertising campaign and overtime labor-hours if the profit from
each Classic Transporter sold and each Family Adventurer sold continue to be the same?

Problem 7. Knowing that the advertising campaign costs $500,000 and the maximum
usage of overtime labor-hours cost $1,600,000, is the solution found in part (6) a wise decision compared to the solution found in part (1)?

Problem 8. The company has determined that dealerships are actually heavily discounting
the price of the Family Adventurers to move them off the lot. Because of a profit-sharing
agreement with its dealers, the company is therefore not making a profit of $3,700 on the
Family Adventurer but is instead making a profit of $2,800. Determine the number of Family
Adventurers and the number of Classic Transporters that should be assembled given this new
discounted price. Consider all the possible scenarios: using/not using advertising campaign
and using/not using overtime labor. What is the most profitable this time?

Problem 9. The company has discovered quality problems with the Family Adventurer
by randomly testing Adventurers at the end of the assembly line. Inspectors have discovered that in over 60 percent of the cases, two of the four doors on an Adventurer do not
seal properly. Because the percentage of defective Adventurers determined by the random
testing is so high, the floor supervisor has decided to perform quality control tests on every
Adventurer at the end of the line. Because of the added tests, the time it takes to assemble
one Family Adventurer has increased from 6 to 7.5 hours. Determine the number of units of
each model that should be assembled given the new assembly time for the Family Adventurer.

Problem 10. The board of directors of the automobile company wishes to capture a larger
share of the luxury sedan market and therefore would like to meet the full demand for Classic
Transporters. They ask William to determine by how much the profit of his assembly plant
would decrease as compared to the profit found in part (1). They then ask him to meet the
full demand for Classic Transporters if the decrease in profit is not more than $2,000,000.
Should he meet the full demand?

Problem 11. William now makes his final decision by combining all the new considerations
described in parts (6), (7), and (8). What are his final decisions on whether to undertake
the advertising campaign, whether to use overtime labor, the number of Family Adventurers
to assemble, and the number of Classic Transporters to assemble?
